  <h1 class="blog-title">Primer: Adding Descriptions to Image in Social Media</h1>
  <p>
    In a website you control, you hopefully have alt text for your images--some way to let the users to know what is in the images even if they can't see them well. On other websites, you might never get that option.
  </p>
  <p>
    But some social media sites do allow for the addition of descriptions, a version of alt-text to help anyone unable to view the image.
  </p>
  <p>
    Twitter is a good example of this. Starting with the menu on desktop you see when you click your user icon, go to "Settings", then <em>"Accessibility"</em>. Under "Image Options", click to check the checkbox next to "Compose image descriptions".
  </p>
  <p>
    On mobile, there are a few extra steps: After clicking your user icon for the menu, click "Settings and privacy". Under General in the submenu that appears, click "Display and sound". In the next submenu, click Accessibility. From there, directions are the same--just make sure to check the box next to "Compose image descriptions".
  </p>
  <p>
    Now when you add an image in Twitter, you'll have an option to add a description. These do not have a character limit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Twitter even has a <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20174660">whole page with directions</a> for users of different devices to set this up and use them.
