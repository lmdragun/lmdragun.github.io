  <h1 class="blog-title">Word Choice for Accessibility</h1>
  <p>When talking about accessibility, we often talk about inclusive design--but rarely do people talk about <em>inclusive language</em>.</p>
  <p>Often, at meetups, at conferences, and elsewhere, I'll hear people use terms that are just...not okay. Social media, of course, is full of them: Calling something you disagree with "insane", someone who is being foolish "blind", etc.</p>
  <p>In conversation, everyone is somewhat expecting these. In social media, even, it's so common place that avoiding it would be hard. On a business website? In your app?</p>
  <p>There is no reason for something you should have proofread to include such language.</p>
  <p>You're overlooking a possible customer base, you're actively doing harm to people who could be users, all because you don't want to use professional language--there's nothing "cool" or "daring" about that. It's just lazy.</p>
  <p>Here's a really easy standard to follow for the <em>bare minimum</em> of inclusive language: Don't use any words that
    <ul>
      <li>have been used as slurs, especially within the last century, or</li>
      <li>are medical terms when you're not talking about medical topics.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>There's other words and terms to avoid, of course, but it's surprising how many companies don't follow even these most basic of standards.</p>
