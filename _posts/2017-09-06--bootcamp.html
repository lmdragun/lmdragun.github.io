  <h1 class="blog-title">My Bootcamp Experience</h1>
  <p>I attended a coding bootcamp in the Spring of 2015, General Assembly DC's Web Development Immersive. It was a 12-week, full time program, and most weekdays I was there 9am to 9pm, and also sometimes on the weekends. After graduating, I spent about a month job searching before getting an offer I took, for a position as a junior web developer at PBS.</p>
  <p>I had always been messing around with HTML/CSS and had done a bit of jQuery. In high school, I took C++ as Computer Math, but was mostly discouraged from going into Computer Science as it was "for boys." While unemployed and depressed, I decided to try a few free online tutorials and take a cheap one-night intro to Ruby on Rails in town.</p>
  <p>When I decided to take a bootcamp, I sort of went all-in. I quickly researched and contacted the ones in my area (I was trying to find one locally) and went through the application process for General Assembly, which had a cohort starting within a few weeks. A week out, I was told that someone had dropped and since I was first on the waitlist I had a spot. There was pre-work, which was thankfully fairly basic, that I did in a whirlwind of activity.</p>
  <p>The bootcamp itself was about as stressful as one could imagine. It was often compared to "trying to drink from a firehose" when people tried to describe the method in which we were taught--a great deal of information, in a very limited amount of time. Some people struggled from the beginning--some hadn't done the pre-work and therefore weren't ready for class, some weren't prepared to not be good at something right away, some just weren't cut out for that sort of learning. We had a few drop-outs, though I think the most memorable was one person dropping out a week before the end.</p>
  <p>While some people were holding down part-time jobs during the bootcamp, I was thankful I wasn't. Though my unemployment checks went almost entirely to my rent and I ended up with quite a bit of credit card debt, I knew I wouldn't have been able to handle the extra stress, mentally or physically. While it did hurt me a bit in the end, as I basically took the first job offer I got after graduation because my unemployment had run out and I was worse than broke, one benefit of being on unemployment insurance was that I was expected to be job searching the whole time--meaning I was networking while others hadn't even thought about their job search yet, and I was getting lots of contacts because of that. I think at least half of my job interviews came from networking.</p>
  <p>One of my biggest regrets, actually, is that I didn't have the flexibility afterwards to choose a job that might have been more of an apprenticeship (which a few shops around DC did) or even a more stressful one at an agency or established startup, where I'd be constantly coding and doing more challenging work.</p>
  <p>I've spoken to others who were in bad economic situations after bootcamp who have had similar issues, where the first job was probably not the best first job for a bootcamp grad, either because of lack of mentorship and training, low salaries for the industry, or other issues. This particular part of the economic divide is not something I think many people discuss when talking about these programs--those of us that could (technically) afford to do a bootcamp, but couldn't afford to make the best choices after.</p>
  <p>And while I do enjoy coding, and being able to create apps and whatnot, my personal time has been taken up by volunteering, minor socializing, and dealing with health problems. This left me at a disadvantage for tech interviews, as I didn't have much new code to show and also wasn't from a background where I could easily understand and solve algorithms.</p>
  <p>At this point, over two years out, I am in fact moving to a different role within the tech industry. Would I have stayed a web developer, if my situation had been a little different? Probably. While I always wanted to eventually work more with people than code, I had also planned to make it to a senior dev position before branching out, so I would have more experience and credibility. There's also a touch of shame in knowing I'm going into a "soft skills" tech job as a femme despite not facing rampant misogyny at my work place.</p>
