  <h1 class="blog-title">Some Problems with Tech Screenings</h1>
  <p>After an initial screening call, maybe two (or three, because interviewees aren't supposed to have lives), there’s normally the tech screen. Which can take...a variety of forms.</p>

  <p>The Mindboggling People:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Almost always, it's a stranger giving the screening. Not the person I've talked to before, someone whose name I don't even always know before answering the phone.</li>
    <li>A conference call with only one person talking to me (that I could hear). The looming presence of an unknown number of others.</li>
    <li>An endless stream of people who aren’t on the team I’d be working with, don’t code in the languages I know, and awkwardly ask me questions they found online.</li>
    <li>Being told 'yes, I would Google this, too' and then getting yelled at when I jokingly asked 'Well, okay, then can I Google it?'</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Gross Misuse of Tech:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lots and lots of repls. So many repls. Sometimes neither of us know how to use them. Sometimes we do, but neither of us know why they’re not working.</li>
    <li>A guy from a major tech company who really, really wanted me to support the use of “!important” in css and me trying very hard to give examples of how to avoid using it.</li>
    <li>For a junior frontend web developer role: Big O. When I stated I was only familiar with the basics, we spent the entire call with the guy teaching me the intricacies of it. No other questions.</li>
    <li>A Javascript repl that allowed importing Underscore and Moment, but not jQuery.</li>
    <li>An actual whiteboard. Not a repl, not a google doc--MSPaint online. For live code. While we were on a phone call.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some of my ideas, based on experience, of how people can fix their tech screenings:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Stop trying to find people outside of your team to give another opinion, if they don't work on similar projects.</li>
    <li>Talk problems out at a higher level, don't make the person do more than pseudocode. Chances are if they can come up with what a solution would be, they'd know enough to get the code to work in a real life situation.</li>
    <li>Understand that a phone call with a complete stranger and a computer screen are not conducive to a comfortable environment, even if the person is sitting at home.</li>
    <li>If there's going to be live coding, make it pair programming. And warn the person in advance.</li>
    <li>And stop pretending it's 'just like real life!' if the person can't even check StackOverflow.</li>
  </ul>
