      <p>Many people are familiar with the phenomenon of the relative who is impossible to get off the phone with--in my case, it tends to be my mother (and don't worry, she's well aware). At the time I was coming up with this project, Cookie Collector was a big hit, so I decided to create a browser-based game along the same lines, designed to entertain the player and demonstrate Javascript capabilities. This also includes a retro 90s design of completely hand-rolled CSS.</p>

      <h3 class="project__section">Example User Stories:</h3>
      <p>These breakdown tasks to make it easier to focus on individual aspects of an app. Separated into "Current" (what I knew I could finish), "Backlog" (what I hoped to get to), and "Icebox" (which I would have to work on after the project ended). These are a few of the stories I created.</p>
      <h4 class="user-stories__type">Current</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>As a user, when I hit start, the game starts.</li>
        <li>As a user, when I choose an answer, points are affected.</li>
        <li>As a user, when I am near losing, there are warnings I can see.</li>
        <li>As a user, when I lose the game, I can start a new game.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="user-stories__type">Backlog</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>As a user, when the mother asks a question, I am rewarded for choosing an answer.</li>
        <li>As a user, when I get a high score, I can put in my initials.</li>
        <li>As a user, when I try to get off the phone with the mom, it affects my points.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="user-stories__type">Ice Box</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>As a user, when I reach a certain score, I have more options for gaining points.</li>
        <li> As a user, when I win a level, I move onto another level.</li>
      </ul>
